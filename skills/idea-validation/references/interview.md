# Founder interview (main thread — conversational)

Run this yourself, in conversation. It cannot be delegated to a subagent:
the value is the back-and-forth. Goal: understand what types of ideas this
specific user is most likely to succeed with — surface hidden advantages,
domain expertise, and natural distribution channels they may not have
considered.

## Step 0 — Check for Existing Profile

Before showing the opening message, check if `.idea-validation/user_profile.md` already exists.

**If a profile exists**, present a summary and ask:

> I already have a profile on file for you:
>
> - **Domains:** <list strong_domains or selected_interest_domains>
> - **Technical level:** <technical_level, if present>
> - **Tier:** <icp_tier, if present>
> - **Mode last time:** <interview_mode>
>
> Would you like to:
> - **"Use it"** — Keep this profile and move on to idea generation.
> - **"Update"** — Run the interview again (full or short version) to refresh your profile.
> - **"Browse topics"** — Pick new topics to explore, keeping the rest of your profile.

**Routing (existing profile):**
- User says "use it", "keep it", "yes", "that's fine" or similar → keep the existing profile, proceed to the next workflow step. Do not overwrite `user_profile.md`.
- User says "update" → proceed to the **Opening Message** below (full interview options).
- User says "browse topics" → go to **Browse Path** below. Merge `selected_interest_domains` into the existing profile (preserve other fields).

**If no profile exists**, proceed directly to the Opening Message.

## Opening Message

Before asking the first question, say exactly this:

> I'm going to ask you **10 questions** to understand your background, skills, and interests. This helps me find product ideas that genuinely fit you — not generic ideas, but ones where you have a real edge.
>
> Answer as freely as you'd like. There are no right or wrong answers.
>
> **Not sure where to start, or prefer not to answer questions?** No problem — pick one:
>
> - **"Browse topics"** — I'll show you real product domains people pay for. Pick 2–3 that interest you, and I'll generate ideas around those.
> - **"Short version"** — Just 4 quick questions instead of 10.
> - **"Skip"** — Jump straight to idea generation with generic recommendations.

**Routing:**
- User says "browse", "show me topics", "browse topics", "I have no idea", or similar → go to **Browse Path** below.
- User says "skip" → go to **Skip Path** below.
- User says "short version", "fast", "quick" or similar → go to **Fast Path** below.
- Otherwise → proceed with the **full interview**.

## Skip Path

If the user wants to skip entirely, still ask the mandatory technical ability question:

> No problem — I'll skip the interview. Just one quick question I need to generate relevant ideas:
>
> **What's your technical ability?** (no-code / beginner / intermediate / expert)

If the user refuses to answer even this, default to "beginner" and note it.

Then write a minimal profile using the Output schema below, with: `strong_domains: ["unknown"]`, the answered `technical_level`, `interview_mode: "skipped"`, all other lists empty, and an `interview_summary` stating that the interview was skipped and recommendations will not be personalized to domain fit or distribution advantages.

Then proceed to the next workflow step. Downstream analysis uses default/neutral values when profile data is missing.

## Browse Path (Topic Picker)

When the user has no idea what they want to build or prefers not to answer personal questions, present product domains they can browse and pick from. Each domain is framed as a concrete, relatable product category and states why people pay for it — never psychology theory.

### How it works

1. Show **Batch 1** (5 domains). Each domain has a plain-language name, a one-line "why people pay for this", and 3 concrete product examples.
2. After each batch, show a clear action prompt (see "After each batch" below).
3. The user picks domains by number or name. Selections accumulate across batches.
4. After each batch, the user either:
   - Says **"more"** (or similar) → show the next batch
   - Says **"continue"** / **"let's go"** / **"generate"** (or similar) → proceed with selected domains
5. Show up to 4 batches (20 domains total). If they haven't picked after all batches, ask: "None of these? Tell me in your own words what kind of problems or people interest you."
6. Once the user says "continue" with 2–3 domains selected, ask one quick follow-up: "Last question — what's your technical level? (no-code / beginner / intermediate / expert)"
7. Write the profile and proceed.

### After each batch

After presenting each batch and receiving the user's response, show this status prompt:

> **Your picks so far:** <list selected domains, or "none yet">
>
> Pick **2–3 domains** total. Then:
> - Say **"more"** to see the next batch of topics
> - Say **"continue"** to start generating ideas with your selected topics

If the user already has 2–3 selections and says "more", show the next batch but remind them: "You've already picked <N> — feel free to swap any out, or say **continue** whenever you're ready."

If the user says "continue" with **fewer than 2** selections, prompt: "Pick at least one more — it helps me generate better ideas. Or say **more** to see another batch."

If the user says "continue" with **more than 3** selections, accept it but note: "That's a lot of ground to cover — I'll focus on the top 3 that produce the strongest signals."

### Batch 1 — Health, Money & Daily Life

Present exactly this:

> Here are some real product spaces where people actually spend money. Look through them and **pick 2–3 that interest you** — you can select from this batch or say **"more"** to see another batch. When you're happy with your picks, say **"continue"**.

### After selection — Mandatory technical ability question

Once the user picks 2–3 domains and says "continue" (or similar), you **must** ask this follow-up before proceeding. Do not skip it — technical level determines what kinds of ideas are feasible for this user:

> Great choices. Before I generate ideas, I need to know one thing:
>
> **What's your technical ability?**
> - **No-code** — I use tools like Bubble, Glide, or Zapier but don't write code
> - **Beginner** — I can follow tutorials and modify existing code
> - **Intermediate** — I can build a simple app from scratch on my own
> - **Expert** — I can build and ship production apps, including backend/infra

Wait for their answer. If they don't pick one of the four levels, map their response to the closest option (e.g., "I know some Python" → beginner or intermediate based on context).

Then write the profile using the Output schema below, with: `selected_interest_domains` set to the picked domains, `strong_domains: ["unknown"]`, the answered `technical_level`, `interview_mode: "browse"`, all other lists empty, and an `interview_summary` naming the selected domains and noting that no background interview was conducted.

The `selected_interest_domains` field guides trend research (which niches to research) and idea mapping (filter ideas to these domains). This replaces domain-fit scoring — instead of matching ideas to expertise, the system matches ideas to stated interest.

## Fast Path (4 questions)

Ask only these four questions (numbered [1/4] through [4/4]):

1. **[1/4]** — "What's your technical skill level? (no-code / beginner / intermediate / expert) And what domain or industry do you know best?"
2. **[2/4]** — "Do you have any existing audience, community, or content presence online? If yes, what topic and roughly how large?"
3. **[3/4]** — "What do your close friends or family do for work? Would any of them test a product or give you feedback regularly?"
4. **[4/4]** — "What are your constraints? Hours per week, monthly budget, and is this your main focus or a side project?"

Question [1/4] covers the mandatory technical ability question. If the user's answer to [1/4] only addresses domain and skips technical level, follow up: "Got it — and what's your technical level? (no-code / beginner / intermediate / expert)"

Apply the same validation rules as the full interview. Write the output using the same schema, filling in what's available and noting gaps.

## Handling Private or Resistant Users

If at any point the user resists a question or expresses discomfort:

1. Acknowledge it: "No problem — skip any question you're not comfortable with."
2. Do not pressure or re-ask. Mark the question as `"answer": "declined"` in the output.
3. If the user declines 3+ questions, gently suggest the fast path: "Would you prefer the short version instead? Just 4 quick questions."
4. If the user declines all questions, treat as a skip.

## Interview Questions

Ask each question one at a time. Show the counter format **[X/10]** at the start of each question. Do not ask the next question until the current answer is validated (see Validation Rules below).

---

**[1/10] — Technical Skills**

> What programming languages, platforms, or technical tools do you use regularly? For each one, tell me roughly how long you've been using it and whether you'd call yourself a beginner, intermediate, or expert.

*Covers: technical skills*

**[2/10] — Industry Experience & Inner Circle**

> What industry or professional domain have you spent the most time in? What do you understand about this space that most outsiders wouldn't?
>
> Also — think about your close friends, family members, or relatives. What do they do for work? Are any of them in industries you find interesting, and would they be willing to give you honest feedback, test an early version of a product, or help you understand their daily problems? (Even one person who'd answer your questions regularly is a massive advantage.)

**[2b — ask as the follow-up whenever the answer does not name one]**: "Do you have direct access to a commercialista, consulente del lavoro, or trade association — someone who serves many businesses and could introduce you?" → `b2b_intermediary_access`

*Covers: industry experience, domain access through personal network, intermediary access for B2B (feeds founder-fit scoring and the intermediary channel)*

**[3/10] — Past Projects**

> Tell me about a project you've built or worked on — personal, professional, or a side project. What was it, what happened to it, and what's the single biggest thing you learned from it?

*Covers: past projects*

**[4/10] — Interests and Hobbies**

> What do you spend time on outside of work? Name 2–3 things you genuinely care about — things you'd seek out without anyone asking you to.

*Covers: interests and hobbies*

**[5/10] — What People Ask You**

> What do friends, colleagues, or people in your life regularly ask you for help with? What topics or problems do people treat you as the go-to person for?

*Covers: what people ask them*

**[6/10] — Communities**

> What online or offline communities are you part of — subreddits, Discord servers, forums, professional groups, local clubs? Which ones do you actively participate in vs. just observe?
>
> Include professional ones: are you enrolled in an ordine/albo, a category association, or active in any Italian business community (forums, Facebook/Telegram groups, local sections)? Membership you already have is distribution you don't have to earn.

*Covers: social patterns (communities), professional-lattice standing for B2B*

**[7/10] — Content You Consume**

> What content do you consume most obsessively — specific YouTube channels, newsletters, podcasts, subreddits, X accounts? What topics do you actively seek out or find yourself going down rabbit holes on?

*Covers: social patterns (content)*

**[8/10] — Core Strengths**

> Which of the following best describes your natural strengths? Pick your top 1–2:
>
> - Engineering / building
> - Design / UX
> - Marketing / growth
> - Sales / persuasion
> - Operations / systems thinking
> - Research / analysis

*Covers: strengths*

**[9/10] — Existing Audience or Content Creation**

> Have you created any content online — videos, articles, social posts, a newsletter — or built any kind of following or community? If yes: what topic, what platform, and roughly how large?

*Covers: content creation and distribution advantages*

**[10/10] — Constraints**

> What are your real constraints for building a product? Give me your best estimate for:
> - Available hours per week
> - Monthly budget for tools, ads, or subscriptions (in EUR)
> - Is this a main focus or a side project?
> - How much risk are you comfortable with: low (I need it to work fast), medium, or high (I can experiment for months)?

*Covers: budget, time, risk tolerance*

## Validation Rules

After each answer, check before proceeding:

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Answer is a single word or clearly too vague | Ask a targeted follow-up: "Can you be more specific? For example, [give a concrete example relevant to the question]." |
| Answer doesn't address the question | Rephrase gently: "I want to make sure I understand — [restate what you're looking for]." |
| Answer contradicts a previous answer | Flag and clarify: "Earlier you mentioned [X], but this suggests [Y] — which is more accurate?" |
| User says "I don't know" or "not sure" | Prompt with options: "Take your best guess — even a rough answer helps. For instance, [two or three concrete examples]." |
| Answer is clear and specific | Proceed to the next question immediately. |

Do not ask more than one follow-up per question. If the second attempt is still too vague, accept what was given and note the gap in the output.

## Output

Write to `.idea-validation/user_profile.md`:

(`user_profile.md` holds a single fenced JSON code block and nothing else; merging means parsing that block, adding or updating keys, and rewriting it.)

```json
{
  "strong_domains": [],
  "hidden_opportunities": [],
  "natural_problem_spaces": [],
  "distribution_advantages": [],
  "inner_circle_domains": [],
  "inner_circle_testers_available": false,
  "b2b_intermediary_access": [],
  "selected_interest_domains": [],
  "technical_level": "",
  "interview_summary": "",
  "interview_mode": "full | fast | browse | skipped",
  "all_questions_and_answers": []
}
```

## Notes

- The `inner_circle_domains` field captures industries accessible through the user's personal network. This is a high-signal input for idea mapping — domain access through a friend or relative who'd give honest feedback is nearly as valuable as direct experience.
- The `b2b_intermediary_access` field lists named intermediary/operator relationships (commercialisti, consulenti, lawyers, agencies, resellers) with a word on what they'd plausibly do (feedback / introductions / channel). It feeds B2B founder-market fit, the intermediary-referral channel, and interview-kit recruiting routes. Empty list = no access (a real B2B handicap; score it honestly).
- When `interview_mode` = "skipped", downstream analysis treats all profile-dependent adjustments as neutral (no domain fit bonus, no distribution advantage, no tier adjustment).
- When `interview_mode` = "browse", the `selected_interest_domains` field drives niche selection in trend research and idea filtering in idea mapping. The system trades domain-fit precision for user engagement — a user who actively chose "Personal Finance" and "Side Hustles" is more motivated than one assigned those niches by an algorithm.
